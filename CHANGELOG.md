}, config);

// After
await beServer.start(config, null, (app) => {

- Removed global singleton pattern from `fakeSocket.js`
- Updated BEClient (both versions) to instantiate FakeSocket when needed
- Updated Connector to create and reuse FakeSocket instance for local apps
- Updated test files to work with class-based approach
- Added `getSharedLocalSocket()` helper function for local app scenarios

# [0.3.15] - 2025-06-13

### Refactored

- **BEClient Architecture**: Converted from singleton namespace to constructor function pattern
  - **Constructor Function**: BEClient is now a constructor function using `this.property = value` pattern
  - **Instance Isolation**: Each `new BEClient()` call creates an independent instance with its own state
  - **Natural JavaScript Pattern**: Uses standard constructor function approach with `this` context
  - **Private Encapsulation**: Internal variables are properly encapsulated within the function scope

### Breaking Changes

- **Instance Creation**: BEClient must now be instantiated as a constructor with `new` keyword
- **Migration Required**: All consumers must update from `BEClient.method()` to `const client = new BEClient(); client.method()`

### Migration Guide

For BEClient usage:

```javascript
// Before (singleton approach)
import { BEClient } from "brainiac-engine";
BEClient.start(gameApp);

// After (constructor function)
import { BEClient } from "brainiac-engine";
const client = new BEClient();
client.start(gameApp);
```

All BEClient methods remain the same after instantiation:

- `client.start(app)`
- `client.connectToGameServer()`
- `client.getScreen()`
- `client.getResourceStore()`
- `client.getParticlesContainer()`
- `client.getCamera()`
- etc.

# [0.3.14] - 2025-06-13

### Refactored

- **Screen Architecture**: Converted from singleton to instance-based pattern
  - **Instance-based management**: Screen now created and managed within BEClient, similar to camera and particlesContainer
  - **Dependency Injection**: ParticlesContainer and UserEvents now receive Screen instance via constructor parameter
  - **API Access**: Added `BEClient.getScreen()` method for external access to screen functionality
  - **TextToImage Refactor**: Updated TextToImage to accept canvas context parameter instead of relying on global screen
  - **Consistency**: All core engine components (camera, resourceStore, particlesContainer, screen) now follow the same architectural pattern

### Fixed

- **Global Dependencies**: Removed all singleton exports and global references to screen object
- **Server-side Code**: Removed inappropriate client-side screen reference from server/agent/Camera.js
- **Test Coverage**: Updated all tests to use new instance-based approach, including TextToImage.test.js
- **Self-reference Issues**: Fixed internal method calls to use proper instance references

### Enhanced

- **Testability**: Screen system is now easier to test and mock due to dependency injection pattern
- **Flexibility**: Multiple BEClient instances can now have independent screen systems
- **Code Organization**: Cleaner separation of concerns and better dependency management
- **ES Module Compatibility**: Improved module structure and exports

### Breaking Changes

- **Import Changes**: Screen is no longer available as a singleton import - access via `BEClient.getScreen()`
- **TextToImage API**: Now requires canvas context parameter in all method calls
- **ParticlesContainer Constructor**: Now requires Screen instance parameter
- **UserEvents Constructor**: Now requires Screen instance parameter

### Migration Guide

For Screen access:

```javascript
// Before
import { screen } from "./client/Screen.js";
screen.someMethod();

// After
import BEClient from "./client/BEClient.js";
const beClient = new BEClient();
beClient.getScreen().someMethod();
```

For TextToImage usage:

```javascript
// Before
import { textToImage } from "./client/TextToImage.js";
textToImage.drawText("Hello", 100, 100);

// After
import { textToImage } from "./client/TextToImage.js";
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
textToImage.drawText(ctx, "Hello", 100, 100);
```

# [0.3.13] - 2025-06-13

### Refactored

- **ParticlesContainer Architecture**: Converted from singleton to instance-based pattern
  - **Moved out of singleton directory**: ParticlesContainer no longer lives in `/singleton/` folder
  - **Instance-based management**: ParticlesContainer now created and managed within BEClient, similar to camera and resourceStore
  - **Dependency Injection**: Screen.js now receives ParticlesContainer instance via constructor parameter
  - **API Access**: Added `BEClient.getParticlesContainer()` method for external access to particle system
  - **Consistency**: All core engine components (camera, resourceStore, particlesContainer) now follow the same architectural pattern

### Fixed

- **Self-reference Issues**: Fixed internal method calls in ParticlesContainer to use `this` instead of singleton reference
  - Fixed `createCircularEmitter` to use `this.createParticle()` instead of `particlesContainer.createParticle()`
  - Fixed `createSprayEmitter` to use `this.createParticleInSpray()` instead of `particlesContainer.createParticleInSpray()`
- **Z32 Game Compatibility**: Updated Z32 game to use new ParticlesContainer API via `BEClient.getParticlesContainer()`

### Enhanced

- **Testability**: Particle system is now easier to test and mock due to dependency injection pattern
- **Flexibility**: Multiple BEClient instances can now have independent particle systems
- **Code Organization**: Cleaner separation of concerns and better dependency management

### Breaking Changes

- **Import Changes**: Games using ParticlesContainer must now access it via `BEClient.getParticlesContainer()` instead of importing as singleton
- **Directory Structure**: ParticlesContainer moved from `client/singleton/` to `client/` directory

### Migration Guide

Old pattern:

```javascript
import { particlesContainer } from "brainiac-engine";
particlesContainer.createParticle({...});
```

New pattern:

```javascript
import { BEClient } from "brainiac-engine";
const particlesContainer = BEClient.getParticlesContainer();
particlesContainer.createParticle({...});
```
