## Release Notes

### Version 0.2.0 Notes

This release focuses on dramatically improving the developer experience through comprehensive documentation. Every public API, method, class, and function now includes detailed JSDoc comments with:

- Parameter and return type information
- Detailed descriptions and usage notes
- Code examples where appropriate
- Cross-references to related functionality
- Error conditions and edge case documentation

This makes the Brainiac Engine much more accessible to new developers and improves maintainability for existing contributors.
